### üëã Hi, I'm a developer. I make things on the internet work.

Welcome to my GitHub page! My coding adventure began over a decade ago, driven by a fascination with technology and a natural affinity for problem-solving. Starting with Visual Basic 6 as a youngster, I quickly realized that programming was more than a hobby ‚Äì it was my passion.

üöÄ My journey took a significant leap forward when I began exploring Python. This led me to develop a GUI application that integrated with a company CRM, employing a REST API for data handling and visualization. This project was not only a technical milestone but also taught me the importance of data backup the hard way!

üîß Transitioning from individual programming projects, I ventured into the realm of PHP and MySQL. Here, I developed a comprehensive sales management application for an events-based business. This experience honed my skills in creating complex, real-world solutions.

üåê Today, my career has evolved into a leadership role at Ultralytics. Here, I manage a talented team of developers and oversee our DevOps practices. My role involves ensuring that our development processes are efficient, innovative, and aligned with the latest industry standards. I'm dedicated to fostering a collaborative environment where creativity and technical excellence thrive.

üí° As a tech enthusiast and a lifelong learner, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to keep my skills sharp and relevant. I believe in the power of teamwork and the value of sharing knowledge, so feel free to reach out for collaborations or tech discussions.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
